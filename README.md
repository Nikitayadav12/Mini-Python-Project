# 🐍 Mini Python Project

This repository contains a mini project developed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. It showcases a beginner-to-intermediate level application of Python programming, covering real-world logic building and problem-solving.

## 📁 File Included

- `Mini_Project_In_Python.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing the full project code, logic explanation, and output.

## 🚀 Features

- Clear step-by-step coding approach
- Logical problem solving using Python
- Well-commented code for easy readability
- Output included for each block

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- Standard libraries (e.g., `math`, `random`, or others used inside the notebook)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Project Description

> *(Customize this section based on your notebook topic)*

The project simulates or solves a real-world scenario using Python. It may include tasks such as:

- Data processing
- Small-scale simulation or calculator
- Interactive logic using user input
- Loops, conditionals, functions

*(You can update this based on your exact notebook content)*

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Mini_Project_In_Python.ipynb"
3. Run the cells in sequence to view the outputs.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
- Practice with Python basics and control structures
- Experience using functions and handling input/output
- Understanding Python project structuring in notebooks

  ## SELF-DECODING
  👽 Alien Message Decoder
Welcome to the Alien Message Decoder project! This notebook is based on a fictional scenario where the SETI Institute receives encrypted signals from an alien civilization. The aim is to decode and understand their messages using Python.

📚 Project Overview
The SETI Institute received a tuple of encrypted strings from space. Scientists discovered a pattern — each string's length corresponds to a character (with 0 meaning a space, 1 = A, 2 = B, ..., 26 = Z). This notebook walks through the decoding process and even helps generate encrypted responses back to the aliens!

🧠 Key Concepts
Mapping string lengths to alphabet characters

Handling spaces (represented as empty strings)

Creating and reversing dictionaries

Encrypting human messages into alien format

Decoding jumbled words by sorting letters

🛠️ Features
✅ Decrypt alien messages using string length logic

✅ Build custom alphabet dictionaries (including space as 0)

✅ Find keys from values in the dictionary

✅ Encode messages like "why" to send back to aliens

✅ Decode alien jumbled words using string sorting

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository

Open the notebook with Jupyter Notebook / VSCode

Run each cell step-by-step

Modify the encrypted tuple to decode other messages



📷 Sample Output
Alien Message:
("ajsuydtbe", "", "wunjbfusnjrgut", "uhbhr", "oirun", "lpef", "", "vhejsibr", "ydtse", "qlvuusrntuos", "ijwlbutybhlsoaxh")
Decoded Output:

🤖 Tools Used
Basic Data Structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries)

🌌 Inspiration
This project is inspired by SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) and popular science-fiction concepts, blending coding with creativity to decode imagined alien languages.
